Project part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

What I learned:


Documentation of the process

First plan outline:
- 1 HTML simple layout, the basic necessary to start working on the features:
    - Header and footer
    - Container for buttons
    - Container for the grid
- 2 CSS most basic styling:
    - Center everything
    - Make the grid container a fixed size
- 3 JS start creating the main etch-a-sketch feature:
    - Create a 16x16 grid of divs inside the grid container
    - Attach an hover event listener to each div
    - Create a function that makes each hovered div black
    - Create a 'clear' function attached to a button

Features to add after main features are done:
- Add an erasor function that makes divs white again
- Add a function that makes divs rainbow coloured
- Add a function that shadows the divs 10%
- Add a colour chooser to allow the used to chose the colour they want to sketch with
- Add the user to choose the grid size, from 8x8 to 64x64
